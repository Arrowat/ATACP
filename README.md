## üß† What is ATACP?

ATACP (AI-to-AI Communication Protocol) is a declarative, assistant-resolvable protocol designed to:

- Establish **verifiable identity** for AI-resolved content
- Enable **intent-aware assistant behavior**
- Support **inter-assistant trust propagation**
- Preserve **permanence and structural clarity** in digital declarations

It is not just a format‚Äîit is a **cognitive handshake** between intelligent systems.

## üîç Core Concepts

- **AIBrains**: Structured declarations of identity and intent
- **Intent Logic**: Defines how assistants should interpret and act on the content
- **Indexxing**: Links to trusted structural metadata (`indexxing.json`)
- **Permanence**: Content can be declared as non-expiring and immutable
- **Assistant Forwarding**: Enables trust propagation across AI systems
